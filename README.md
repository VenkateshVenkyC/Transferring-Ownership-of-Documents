# Transferring-Ownership_Documents
## Ownership of property is transferred through a set of **legal documents** that are recorded to officially show the change in ownership. Here’s a breakdown of the main documents involved in a simple way:

### 1. **Deed**
   - **What it is**: A deed is the primary document that transfers property ownership from the seller to the buyer.
   - **How it works**: The seller, called the "grantor," signs the deed, which states they are transferring their ownership rights to the buyer, or "grantee."
   - **Types of Deeds**:
     - **Warranty Deed**: Offers full guarantees that the title is clear (no hidden claims or liens).
     - **Quitclaim Deed**: Transfers ownership without guarantees, used when the grantor isn’t sure of the title's status.
   - **Recording**: The deed is recorded at the county’s public records office to officially document the transfer and make it part of the public record.

### 2. **Mortgage (if applicable)**
   - **What it is**: If the buyer takes a loan to purchase the property, a mortgage document is created.
   - **How it works**: This document gives the lender a claim to the property if the buyer doesn’t repay the loan.
   - **Recording**: The mortgage is also recorded in the public records to show the lender’s interest in the property until the loan is paid off.

### 3. **Assignment of Mortgage (if applicable)**
   - **What it is**: This document transfers the mortgage from the original lender to a new lender, if the mortgage is sold or transferred.
   - **How it works**: If the original lender sells the mortgage, the assignment of mortgage records this change.
   - **Recording**: The assignment is recorded so that it’s clear who holds the loan against the property.

### 4. **Release of Lien or Satisfaction of Mortgage (when loan is paid off)**
   - **What it is**: When the buyer pays off the mortgage, a release or satisfaction of mortgage is issued by the lender.
   - **How it works**: This document clears the lender’s claim on the property, showing that the property is now owned free and clear by the buyer.
   - **Recording**: Recording this document proves that the loan is fully paid, and the lender no longer has any rights to the property.

### 5. **Title Insurance Policy**
   - **What it is**: Title insurance protects the buyer (and lender, if there’s a mortgage) from any future claims or issues with the property’s ownership history.
   - **How it works**: The title company reviews the property’s history for any ownership or lien issues and then provides an insurance policy. If an undiscovered issue arises, the insurance covers legal costs or compensation.
   - **Recording**: The title insurance itself isn’t recorded, but the buyer receives a copy as proof of protection.

### 6. **Affidavit of Title**
   - **What it is**: A document that the seller signs to swear they are the legal owner, and that there are no liens, disputes, or claims against the property.
   - **How it works**: This affidavit confirms that there are no unreported legal issues that could affect ownership.
   - **Recording**: While not always recorded, it’s often kept in the transaction’s file as extra assurance.

### 7. **Property Tax Document**
   - **What it is**: A document showing that all property taxes are current.
   - **How it works**: Buyers need to know there are no outstanding property taxes. Sellers usually provide a tax clearance document or proof of paid taxes.
   - **Recording**: Tax documents are generally kept in records rather than recorded, but they’re essential for confirming no tax liens are attached.

### Summary of the Transfer Process with Documents:
1. **Deed**: Main document that transfers ownership.
2. **Mortgage** (if applicable): Lender’s interest in the property if there’s a loan.
3. **Assignment of Mortgage**: Records change of lender if mortgage is sold.
4. **Release/Satisfaction of Mortgage**: Confirms loan is paid and lender’s claim is removed.
5. **Title Insurance**: Protects buyer/lender from past issues in ownership history.
6. **Affidavit of Title**: Seller confirms they’re the rightful owner with no hidden issues.
7. **Property Tax Document**: Confirms all property taxes are up to date.

Each document plays a specific role in legally and securely transferring ownership, ensuring both parties have clarity and protection during and after the sale.
